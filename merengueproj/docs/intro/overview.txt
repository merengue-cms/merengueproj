Merengue overview
=================

Merengue is a fully featured CMS framework built on top of `Django framework`_.
It's not only a plug-and-play CMS but a framework to build CMS sites amazingly
fast and with clean and reusable code, using our preferred web framework.

For achieving that, we have:

 * Taked conventions that are not possible in Django, because with Merengue you
   are building CMS sites and not generic web applications. For example, thanks
   to these conventions we can make Merengue skinnable.

 * Created both a complete API for managing content and a poweful out-of-the-box
   CMS with all basic needed of any CMS site (permissions, theming, plugins,
   actions, etc.).

 * Built a pluggable system that allows plugins create new models, handle URLs,
   defining content or site actions, blocks, creates custom admin zones, etc.

 * Created a default data model with all needed to allow content management.
   You can inherits some of these models in your plugins to create new content
   types.

The goal of this document is to give you enough technical specifics to
understand how Merengue works. When you're ready to start a project, you can
:ref:`start with the tutorial <intro-tutorial>` or :ref:`dive right into more
detailed documentation <topics-index>`.

.. admonition:: Django knowledge needed

    Merengue has been created using Django. You need to know some 
    `Django concepts`_ in order to understand better Merengue ones.

Main Merengue features
======================

These are some Merengue out-of-the-box features

Data model
----------

Merengue cames with a complete data model for managing content. All models will
be translatable by default and may be geolocalized (if you enable GIS).

Some of those models are:

 * Base content, that will be inherits by all managed content types (news
   items, events, documents, forums, etc.). Those content types will share all
   Merengue CMS features (workflow, featured admin interface, permissions, etc.).
 
 * Sections, that will be used to divide your site into several parts, that
   could be managed by different groups of users.

 * Menu items, for creating a navigation inside site or sections. Menu items will
   be hierarchical and will link to some content or external link.

 * Collaborative document, that inherits base content to allow collaborative
   edition and translation by simultaneous users.

 * News items, events, and others, that are defined in Merengue plugins.

Pluggable
---------

A pluggable system definition depends on ``plugin`` concept. For Merengue, a
``plugin`` is a thing that is developed by somene and can be installed without
changing a line of code.

In that sense, when you install a plugin, Merengue will (among other things):

 * Synchronize plugin data models.

 * Register plugin as Django application.

 * Include some URL prefixes to be handled by plugin.

 * Register plugins blocks (zones in screen to render things).

 * Register plugins actions (for content or site wide).

 * Register custom admin sub-sites.

.. admonition:: Django applications

    In our sense of ``pluggable`` concept, Django applications are not plugins,
    because needs some work to integrate in your site (URLs inclusion, change
    settings, sync database, work on templates, etc.)

Permissions
-----------

Merengue include a customizable permissions system, with a good default
permissions for content management. You can define roles, permissions and
grants permissions to roles and contents.

Main advantages with `Django permissions`_ are more granularity and that all
will persist in database, and so can be configurable by admin user, using
management interface.

GIS integrated

Out-of-the-box caching
----------------------

Merengue uses `Johnny Cache`_ to cache all SQL sentences in a smart way. With
this integration you can forgot about queryset caching and invalidation.

Theming
-------

(( to be completed. include two screenshots of a same view with different themes ))

For example, next template will be render blocks located at ``leftsidebar``
place in the rightsidebar zone. You only have to create this template as your
``templates/themes/yourtheme/base.html`` and activate theme in admin interface.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "base/layout.html" %}

    {% load block_tags %}

    {% block rightsidebar %}
      {% render_blocks "leftsidebar" for content %}
      {{ block.super }}
    {% endblock %}

.. admonition:: Django knowledge needed

    Merengue uses Django templating system. See `Django templates` to get more
    info about Merengue templating.

.. Django templates_: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/templates/

Full featured management interface
----------------------------------

The management interface its half based on Django admin (with many steroids)
and half a WYSYWYG interface (for example to manage blocks layout).

Philosophy
==========

Focused on programmers
----------------------

Merengue was created by a Python enthusiast team, who loves elegant code and
clean APIs but with pragmatic approaches to the solution.

With that, you've got a free, and rich, Python API to do almost all things you
can imagine, with a good designed data model for content management.

Look these examples:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from merengue.base.models import BaseContent

    # all contents published in your CMS
    >>> BaseContent.objects.published()
    [...]

    # create a content from a plugin (a news item, that inherits from BaseContent)
    >>> from plugins.news.models import NewsItem
    >>> newsitem = NewsItem(name_es='Mi noticia', name_en='My news item')
    >>> newsitem.publish_date = datetime.datetime.now()
    >>> newsitem.save()

    # managing permissions
    >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    >>> staff_user = User.objects.create(username='roque')
    >>> from merengue.perms.utils import register_permission, register_role
    >>> register_permission('Vote news item', 'vote_newsitem', 
                            for_models=[NewsItem])
    >>> editor = register_role('Editor')
    >>> editor.add_principal(staff_user) # add user to role 'Editor'
    >>> grant_permission(newsitem, editor, 'vote_newsitem')
    >>> has_permission(newsitem, staff_user, 'vote')
    True

(( to be completed. Follow with other philosophic principles ))
