(( to be completed. talk a little about merengue goals and philosophy ))

The goal of this document is to give you enough technical specifics to
understand how Merengue works. When you're ready to start a project, you can
:ref:`start with the tutorial <intro-tutorial>` or :ref:`dive right into more
detailed documentation <topics-index>`.

Focused on programmers
======================

Merengue was created by a Python enthusiast team, who loves elegant code and
clean APIs but with pragmatic approaches to the solution.

With that, you've got a free, and rich, Python API to do almost all things you
can imagine, with a good designed data model for content management.

.. admonition:: Django knowledge needed

    Merengue API has been created using parts of Django API. You need to know
    `Django API`_ to understand better Merengue one.

.. _Django API: http://docs.djangoproject.com/

Look these examples:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from merengue.base.models import BaseContent

    # all contents published in your CMS
    >>> BaseContent.objects.published()
    [...]

    # create a content from a plugin (a news item, that inherits from BaseContent)
    >>> from plugins.news.models import NewsItem
    >>> newsitem = NewsItem(name_es='Mi noticia', name_en='My news item')
    >>> newsitem.publish_date = datetime.datetime.now()
    >>> newsitem.save()

    # managing permissions
    >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    >>> staff_user = User.objects.create(username='roque')
    >>> from merengue.perms.utils import register_permission, register_role
    >>> register_permission('Vote news item', 'vote_newsitem', 
                            for_models=[NewsItem])
    >>> editor = register_role('Editor')
    >>> editor.add_principal(staff_user) # add user to role 'Editor'
    >>> grant_permission(newsitem, editor, 'vote_newsitem')
    >>> has_permission(content, staff_user, 'vote')
    True


A complete management interface
===============================

The management interface its half based on Django admin (with many steroids)
and half a WYSYWYG interface (for example to manage blocks layout).

Theme management
----------------

Block reordering
----------------

Plugin management
-----------------


Theming
=======

(( to be completed ))

For example, next template will be render blocks located at ``leftsidebar``
place in the rightsidebar zone. You only have to create this template as your
``templates/themes/yourtheme/base.html`` and activate theme in admin interface.

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "base/layout.html" %}

    {% load block_tags %}

    {% block rightsidebar %}
      {% render_blocks "leftsidebar" for content %}
      {{ block.super }}
    {% endblock %}

.. admonition:: Django knowledge needed

    Merengue uses Django templating system. See `Django templates` to get more
    info about Merengue templating.

.. Django templates_: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/templates/
