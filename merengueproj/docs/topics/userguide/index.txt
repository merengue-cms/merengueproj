Merengue user guide
===================

This document will guide you for using Merengue as admin of your site. We will
try to show this approach without taking care of technical aspects, just seeing
aspects of graphical configuration, and how Merengue works for the site admin.

.. admonition:: Technical stuff
    
    We assume that you already have a Merengue instance working properly. If 
    you don't, you should have to take a look :ref:`installing merengue <topics-install>` for more
    information about this.


Introduction to Merengue admin site
===================================

Once your Merengue site is active (we suppose in http://localhost:8000), you can
access to your admin site in http://localhost:8000/admin, and you will see 
something like this:

.. image:: _images/merengue_admin_site.png

This site provides you links to several areas where you can configure your site
without writing any code, so you don't need any kind of programming knowledge
to manage a Merengue site.

It's sepparated by some blocks, in function of what you want to do. Those blocks
are:

* **Content management**. Those are links to manage your site's content. You can access from here to the *content*, the *sections*, *portal menus* and *portal links*

* **Multimedia**. You can edit and delete your site's *photos*, *videos*, *audios*, *panoramic views* and *3D images* from this links.

* **Site configuration**. If you want to configure how the site looks, you should use this options. Such as *blocks*, *plugins*, *themes*, *registry* and even *save and restore configuration* to do some backups.

* **User management**. The last block is used to edit *users* privileges, *groups* and *roles*.

.. _topics-userguide-plugins:

Plugins
=======

Merengue works thanks to some external elements called *plugins*. Those plugins
increase the functionality of your site, allowing you to customize your site
in any way you want.

You can access to the plugins configuration clicking **Plugins** in the main
admin page, or going to the URL 
http://localhost:8000/admin/pluggable/registeredplugin and you will see a menu like
the next:

.. image:: _images/merengue_plugin_configuration.png

Installing plugins
------------------

If you are working on a clean Merengue installation, you will only have
activated the **core** plugin. That plugin cannot be disabled because it's
essential to the proper site's behaviour.

Let's activate some plugins, for example the *voting* plugin. We just click in
it's link to go to the configuration of that plugin.

.. image:: _images/voting_plugin_configuration.png

To active a plugin, first you should install it, so you have to check the 
*Installed* element, save the form, and it will be activated. In some case you
want to desactivate the plugin but not uninstalled it, you can uncheck the
*Activate* checkbox.

With this plugin for example, you will be able to allow users to vote some
contents. 

.. admonition:: Technical stuff
    
    You can add more plugins to that list, or even develop your own plugin. 
    Take a look to the :ref:`plugins documentation <topics-plugins-index>` for more information about this.


Themes
======

Merengue has the capability to abstract your information and elements of the
site from the way you see the site itself. This abstraction is called *themes*
and determines how a person see your site.

Merengue comes with some default themes, you can change between them and choose
the one you like the most. To do that, you can just click on **themes** in the
main admin page, or can go to the URL http://localhost:8000/admin/theming/theme/
and you will see a menu like the follow:

.. image:: _images/theme_configuration.png

If you want to activate some theme, you just only have to click on the theme
that you want, and check *Activate* block. This action will disable the current
theme, because you cannot have two differents themes activated at the same time.

Content management
==================

Merengue is a Content Management System (CMS), and as such its main element
are the contents, and you can build your site based on that contents. 

Contents can be anything you want on your site: documents, news, forums, 
articles, tutorials... that's your choice and it will depend of what kind
of site are you developing.

You have to notice that contents are highly related with *sections*. Think
about sections as content containers, so first we have to know how to work
with sections.

Sections
--------

As we said before, sections are like content containers. So, the first step to
create some content is create a section. We go the section menu (in http://localhost:8000/admin/section/section) and see a menu like the next one:

.. image:: _images/sections_configuration.png

In the upper right corner, you will se a button **Add section**. This button 
will address to a form in wich we can configure some aspects of the section:

.. image:: _images/add_section_form.png

You can see that you have the possibility to input text for the different 
languages that your site has. For example we can create a *Foo section*, and
call it in differents ways for each language.

Another important element is *Publication status*. This allows to configure some
kind of workflow on this section. For example we want to set it to *published*.
Once we have created our section, we can customize it and content for this
concrete section.

Once we have created the *Foo section*, we can see a configuration form like the
following:

.. image:: _images/foo_section_configuration.png

We can see in the upper right corner a button called **Section children** that 
is actually a drop-down menu, with the options *custom style*, *documents* and
*main menu*.

.. admonition:: More options

   If we add more plugins (for example *News*) we will have more options to add 
   on sections, like news, media...

To begin editing some elements on the section, let's add a few menus to the 
section. If we click on *main menu*, the list of items is empty, wich is normal 
because we are working on a new section. Clicking on *Add menu*, the form 
displayed is the following:

.. image:: _images/new_menu_item.png

where we just add the options for the new menu item. We can add for example a 
link to the main page of Merengue project: http://www.merengueproject.org/, with
the title *Merengue project*, and linked to that URL. This way we create a child
of *Foo section* that will be displayed as a sub-element of that section on the 
menu.

Content into sections
---------------------

The content type we can add to a section will depend of what plugins we have 
installed on our Merengue instance. For example, we can manage *documents*, the 
default content type that Merengue includes.

If we access to the documents related with *Foo section*, we will se a screen 
like the following:

.. image:: _images/documents_into_section.png

So we have no elements linked with *Foo section*, wich is normal because that 
section have been just created and still not modified. If we want to create a 
new *document* content, just click on the button *Add document*.

This button will address us to a form very similar to the sections form. We can 
add the *title*, *description*, *publication status*, *tags*... For example, we 
can create a content called **Lorem ipsums** and publish it.

This is the way to create content in Merengue. Remember that a content is 
allways related to a section.

Blocks concept
==============

Blocks are very important in Merengue. The defines (in some way) how a page is 
displayed in your browser. Each one of them are related to a module, and can be 
rearranged at will. On the URL 
http://localhost:8000/admin/block/registeredblock/ we can see the blocks enabled
on the site:

.. image:: _images/blocks_list.png

The column called **Placed at** is very important, because it says where the 
block is displayed. For example the *Voting block* (added for the *Voting* 
plugin) is placed before the content body.

Let's suppose that we want to change the position of *Voting block*. There are 
two ways to do that. The first one is on the configuration page of each 
concrete block. We access to that page by clicking the block we want to edit
on the list, and see a form like the following.

.. image:: _images/single_block_configuration.png

For example, we can change the field **Placed at** and move it to the right
sidebar. If we go to the main page http://localhost:8000/ we will see the
voting form on the right:

.. image:: _images/main_page_voting_right.png

The other way to do so is using the graphical interface. If you put the pointer
above some block (for example *Vote content*) you will see a gren button. If
you click it, the display will change to this:

.. image:: _images/main_page_rearranging.png

So you just have to drag and drop the blocks that you want to rearrange.


Navigational elements
=====================

We understand as navigational elements the elements that you see on the page
that will address the user to a different place (inside or outside the site). 
For example the breadcrumb, a menu, portal links and so...

Breadcrumbs
-----------

A breadcrumb is a set of links that gives users a way to keep track of where
are the on the sitemap. For example in the following image:

.. image:: _images/main_page_breadcrumb.png

In this case indicates that the content *Lorem ipsums* is a child of a section 
called *Foo section*. This way we can navigate upstream on the site.

This links are autogenerated so we can't modify them, but it's important to
notice what they are.

Portal menus
------------

Portal links are links that have a full visibility on all the site. At first
we have no portal links configurated, but we can add the links we want in 
http://localhost:8080/admin/section/menu/, and clicking on the top-right button
**Add menu**. Let's add for example links to Google, Twitter and Facebook.

If you go to the main site page, you will se the links like the following links
on top of the page:

.. image:: _images/main_site_site_links.png

If you pass the pointer above those links, you will notice that is a block that
you can drag and drop wherever you want.

Navigation Block
----------------

The navigation block is a block generated by the core plugin. By default it
appears on the left sidebar of the site, as you can see on the previous
image.

This menu displays the elements of the site as a tree view. At the first level
you see the **Sections** of the site. In our example we have *Foo section* and
*Test section*. Then we also see the main menu of that section, in this case
the *Foo section* has a link to Merengue project, so we see that element on the
navigation block.

We can re-order the block as usual, and also can reorder the sections and put 
it how we want.

Portal links
------------

Portal links are similar to `portal menus`_, and they works on a very similar
way. 

.. _`portal menus`: index.html#portal-menus 

There are two differents kind of portal links: **primary links** and **secondary 
links**. We can add any of them from the URL 
http://localhost:8080/admin/portal/portallink/add/ . There we will see a form like
the following:

.. image:: _images/add_portal_link.png

We are going to create two links: a primary link to GMail, and a secondary link
to Wikipedia, to see what are the differences between them. In the following 
image we can notice the difference between them:

.. image:: _images/main_page_menus.png

You can see that the all are blocks, so they can be rearranged at will. Semantically,
**primary links** are links that simplify the navigation  of the site, linking to
important places of the site (for example *News section*).

In the other hand, **portal menus** are links related to a section. For example 
categories on the news.

And **secondary links** are links placed on the footer, not essentials but
importants (like copyright, about, contact...)

As you can see, create and manage those links is very easy, but is important to 
know and notice the difference between them.

Actions
=======

In Merengue we define **actions** as some events that an user trigger with a button.
For example, if we activate the *Facebook* plugin, we will have a link on the content
to share the content in Facebook. To click on that link is an action.

You can see what actions you have on the system accessing the URL 
http://localhost:8080/admin/registry/registereditem/?category=action. Those actions
are provided by differents modules, as well as blocks and other stuff.

Merengue permissions
==========================================

In Merengue we define permissions as the authorization that an user must have for he is able to do something.
For example, if an user wants to edit some content, he need have the edit perm for this content.
If an user wants to manage the sections he need the manage section perm.

The permissions can be globals, you can see on the system accessing the URL 
http://localhost:8080/admin/perms/objectpermission/.
Or locals for each content, you can see in /permissions/ into each content 
http://localhost:8080/admin/base/basecontent/1/permissions/.

To associate permissions with user, we have **roles**. These definen a permission set.
If you associate a role with an user, this user will every permission of the role. Also you can associate
a role with a group, and every user of this group will every permission of the role.

There is a special role: "Anonymous User". Every user will every permission of this role.

Maintenance tasks
=================

There are some tasks that use to be executed on a shell, but Merengue allows the
admin user to do those tasks in a graphic way.

Registry
--------

The registry is a page where you can see all the *registrable items* of the site,
also showing the state of those items. You can see that list on the URL
http://localhost:8080/admin/registry/registereditem/ allowing you to get a 
general view of what is installed on the Merengue instance.

Backups
-------

If we go to the  URL http://localhost:8080/admin/siteconfig/ we will see the 
following page:

.. image:: _images/backup_configuration.png

We can do here 3 things:

* First, we can restore a previous configuration backup
* Create a configuration backup. This backup includes what elements are registred
* Create a database backup. Is a full content backup, to prevent of data losing on your site
