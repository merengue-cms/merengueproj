Merengue user guide
===================

This document will guide you for using Merengue as admin of your site. We will
try to show this approach without taking care of technical aspects, just seeing
aspects of graphical configuration, and how Merengue works for the site admin.

.. admonition:: Technical stuff
    
    We assume that you already have a Merengue instance working properly. If 
    you don't, you should have to take a look `installing merengue`_ for more
    information about this.

Introduction to Merengue admin site
===================================

Once your Merengue site is active (we suppose in http://localhost:8000), you can
access to your admin site in http://localhost:8000/admin, and you will see 
something like this:

.. image:: _images/merengue_admin_site.png

This site provides you links to several areas where you can configure your site
without writing any code, so you don't need any kind of programming knowledge
to manage a Merengue site.

It's sepparated by some blocks, in function of what you want to do. Those blocks
are:

* **Content management**. Those are links to manage your site's content. You can access from here to the *content*, the *sections*, *portal menus* and *portal links*

* **Multimedia**. You can edit and delete your site's *photos*, *videos*, *audios*, *panoramic views* and *3D images* from this links.

* **Site configuration**. If you want to configure how the site looks, you should use this options. Such as *blocks*, *plugins*, *themes*, *registry* and even *save and restore configuration* to do some backups.

* **User management**. The last block is used to edit *users* privileges, *groups* and *roles*.


Plugins
=======

Merengue works thanks to some external elements called *plugins*. Those plugins
increase the functionality of your site, allowing you to customize your site
in any way you want.

You can access to the plugins configuration clicking **Plugins** in the main
admin page, or going to the URL 
http://localhost:8000/admin/pluggable/registeredplugin and you will see a menu like
the next:

Installing plugins
------------------

If you are working on a clean Merengue installation, you will only have
activated the **core** plugin. That plugin cannot be disabled because it's
essential to the proper site's behaviour.

Let's activate some plugins, for example the *voting* plugin. We just click in
it's link to go to the configuration of that plugin.

To active a plugin, first you should install it, so you have to check the 
*Installed* element, save the form, and it will be activated. In some case you
want to desactivate the plugin but not uninstalled it, you can uncheck the
*Activate* checkbox.

With this plugin for example, you will be able to allow users to vote some
contents.
