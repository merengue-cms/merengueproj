Merengue user guide
===================

This document will guide you for using Merengue as admin of your site. We will
try to show this approach without taking care of technical aspects, just seeing
aspects of graphical configuration, and how Merengue works for the site admin.

.. admonition:: Technical stuff
    
    We assume that you already have a Merengue instance working properly. If 
    you don't, you should have to take a look `installing merengue`_ for more
    information about this.

Introduction to Merengue admin site
===================================

Once your Merengue site is active (we suppose in http://localhost:8000), you can
access to your admin site in http://localhost:8000/admin, and you will see 
something like this:

.. image:: _images/merengue_admin_site.png

This site provides you links to several areas where you can configure your site
without writing any code, so you don't need any kind of programming knowledge
to manage a Merengue site.

It's sepparated by some blocks, in function of what you want to do. Those blocks
are:

* **Content management**. Those are links to manage your site's content. You can access from here to the *content*, the *sections*, *portal menus* and *portal links*

* **Multimedia**. You can edit and delete your site's *photos*, *videos*, *audios*, *panoramic views* and *3D images* from this links.

* **Site configuration**. If you want to configure how the site looks, you should use this options. Such as *blocks*, *plugins*, *themes*, *registry* and even *save and restore configuration* to do some backups.

* **User management**. The last block is used to edit *users* privileges, *groups* and *roles*.


Plugins
=======

Merengue works thanks to some external elements called *plugins*. Those plugins
increase the functionality of your site, allowing you to customize your site
in any way you want.

You can access to the plugins configuration clicking **Plugins** in the main
admin page, or going to the URL 
http://localhost:8000/admin/pluggable/registeredplugin and you will see a menu like
the next:

Installing plugins
------------------

If you are working on a clean Merengue installation, you will only have
activated the **core** plugin. That plugin cannot be disabled because it's
essential to the proper site's behaviour.

Let's activate some plugins, for example the *voting* plugin. We just click in
it's link to go to the configuration of that plugin.

.. image:: _images/voting_plugin_configuration.png

To active a plugin, first you should install it, so you have to check the 
*Installed* element, save the form, and it will be activated. In some case you
want to desactivate the plugin but not uninstalled it, you can uncheck the
*Activate* checkbox.

With this plugin for example, you will be able to allow users to vote some
contents. 

.. admonition:: Technical stuff
    
    You can add more plugins to that list, or even develop your own plugin. 
    Take a look to the `plugins documentation`_ for more information about this.

.. _`plugins documentation`: http://docs.merengueproject.org/topics/plugins/index.html

Themes
======

Merengue has the capability to abstract your information and elements of the
site from the way you see the site itself. This abstraction is called *themes*
and determines how a person see your site.

Merengue comes with some default themes, you can change between them and choose
the one you like the most. To do that, you can just click on **themes** in the
main admin page, or can go to the URL http://localhost:8000/admin/theming/theme/
and you will see a menu like the follow:

.. image:: _images/theme_configuration.png

If you want to activate some theme, you just only have to click on the theme
that you want, and check *Activate* block. This action will disable the current
theme, because you cannot have two differents themes activated at the same time.

Content management
==================

Merengue is a Content Management System (CMS), and as such its main element
are the contents, and you can build your site based on that contents. 

Contents can be anything you want on your site: documents, news, forums, 
articles, tutorials... that's your choice and it will depend of what kind
of site are you developing.

You have to notice that contents are highly related with *sections*. Think
about sections as content containers, so first we have to know how to work
with sections.

Sections
--------

As we said before, sections are like content containers. So, the first step to
create some content is create a section. We go the section menu (in http://localhost:8000/admin/section/section) and see a menu like the next one:

.. image:: _images/sections_configuration.png

In the upper right corner, you will se a button **Add section**. This button 
will address to a form in wich we can configure some aspects of the section:

.. image:: _images/add_section_form.png

You can see that you have the possibility to input text for the different 
languages that your site has. For example we can create a *Foo section*, and
call it in differents ways for each language.

Another important element is *Publication status*. This allows to configure some
kind of workflow on this section. For example we want to set it to *published*.
Once we have created our section, we can customize it and content for this
concrete section.
