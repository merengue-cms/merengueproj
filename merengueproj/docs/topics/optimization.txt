Optimizing a Merengue installation
==================================

Merengue features several optimization settings that can greatly increase your site performance.

Site Cache for anonymous users
==============================

Merengue takes advantage of the built-in anonymous site caching from Django. You can activate this feature in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHE_SITE_FOR_ANONYMOUS = True

This setting will cache all request from anonymous users, so the view that generates the response template is only run the first time.

Note that, unlike Django's default behaviour, Merengue caches all requests even if they have GET or POST parameters.

Cache invalidation
------------------

There are certains occasions where a site manager would want to invalidate the cache for a certain URL. Think for example a news item published with a mistake that needs to be amended right away: anonymous users will keep on reading the cached version until it expires, which usually takes a whole day. Is in the interest of the site managers to force the invalidation of the cache version once the news item has been corrected.

When the cache is active and a manager is logged in, a new button named ``invalidate cache`` is added to the Merengue toolbar. Clicking on it will invalidate the cache for the current page. Note that the invalidation takes effect for all installed languages in the site.
