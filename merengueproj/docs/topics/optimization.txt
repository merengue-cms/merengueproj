==================================
Optimizing a Merengue Installation
==================================

Merengue features several optimization settings that can greatly increase the
performance of your site.


Disabling debug mode
====================

The first thing to do in a production site is disabling the debug mode by
setting the ``DEBUG`` setting to ``False``. This will speed up three times the
Merengue performance, mainly due to the Django Debug Toolbar, which by default
is enabled in debug mode.


Compressing Javascript and CSS files
====================================

For performance reasons, Merengue will place most Javascript files close to the
``</body>`` HTML tag. CSS assets will be located in the ``<head>`` section.

You can compress these files by setting the ``COMPRESS`` setting to
``True``

.. note::

    By default the ``COMPRESS`` setting is set to ``not DEBUG``. If you set ``DEBUG`` to
    ``False`` when deploying the website (recomended practice), you do not have
    to explicitly change the ``COMPRESS`` setting to ``False``.

Configuring Caching
===================

Merengue uses caching for the following optimizations:

* **Cache the SQL sentences**, using `Johnny Cache`_. This fantastic application provides transparent caching for all of your data models. When a user updates any model content, the cache for this model is invalidated transparently.
* **Block caching**. All blocks can be cached if configured in the administrative interface. See :ref:`block caching <topics-userguide-block_caching>` in the User Guide for more information.
* **Anonymous cache for entire site**. The entire site can be cached for anonymous users. See :ref:`site caching for anonymous users <topics-optimization-anonymous-cache>`.
* **Template caching**, included in Django >1.2. See :ref:`template cache <topics-optimization-template-cache>`.

Local memory is used, by default, for all Merengue caching. However, a problem
arises when the local memory backend is used in multithreaded environments with the setting:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'johnny.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
            'KEY_PREFIX': SECRET_KEY,
        }
    }

In multithreaded environments, this configuration may cause random errors where
views are not refreshed correctly after content modification, because the 
invalidation action will only happen in one thread's memory and not in the other
threads. The "fix" for this problem is to change the cache backend to something
like memcached:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'johnny.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
            'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
            'JOHNNY_CACHE': True,
        }
    }

.. _topics-optimization-template-cache:


Template Caching
================

Django 1.3 allows for the caching of compiled templates (see 
`django.template.loaders.cached.Loader loader`_). This could vastly speed up a
Merengue site because Merengue page layouts are rendered with many templates
which display specific parts of each page.

In order to activate the caching of templates, you will need to change the
``TEMPLATE_LOADERS`` setting in your project settings as follow:

.. code-block:: python

    TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
        ('django.template.loaders.cached.Loader', TEMPLATE_LOADERS),
    )

The ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS`` variable is defined in the ``merengue/settings.py`` file.
Essentially, we've wrapped the Merengue template loaders with the
``django.template.loaders.cached.Loader`` loader.

See more on template caching in :ref:`Optimizing a Merengue installation <topics-optimization>`.

.. _`django.template.loaders.cached.Loader loader`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/templates/api/#loader-types

.. _topics-optimization-anonymous-cache:


Site Caching for Anonymous Users
================================

Merengue takes advantage of the built-in anonymous site caching feature from Django.
You can activate this capability in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHE_SITE_FOR_ANONYMOUS = True

This setting will cache all requests from anonymous users so that the view that
generates the response template is only run once.

Note, that unlike Django's default behaviour, Merengue caches all requests even if they have GET parameters.

Cache Invalidation
------------------

There are certain situations where a site manager would want to invalidate the cache
for a certain URL. For example, consider a news item published with a mistake that
needs to be corrected immediately. Anonymous users will keep on reading the cached
version until it expires (which usually takes a whole day). It is in the best
interest of the site managers to force the invalidation of the cached version
once the news item has been corrected.

When the cache is active and a manager is logged in, a new button named ``invalidate cache``
is added to the Merengue toolbar. Clicking this button will invalidate the cache
for the current page. Note that the invalidation takes effect for all languages
installed on the site.


Session Cache
=============

By default Merengue sessions are implemented by Django. Django sessions are
stored by default in the project database. Thus, all requests will execute at
least one SQL expression to fetch the current session. You can avoid
this SQL activity by using cached sessions (for example in Memcached). See the
`Django cached sessions`_ documentation for more information.
