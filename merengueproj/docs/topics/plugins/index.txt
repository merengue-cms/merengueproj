Working with plugins
====================

Overview
========

Plugin configuration is defined in a ``PluginConfig`` class in a ``config.py`` module inside your plugin directory. This class is readed when plugin is loaded in merengue.


.. _topics-plugins-configuration:

Configuration
=============

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    from merengue.plugin import Plugin
    
    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        url_prefixes = (
            ('fooplugin', 'plugins.fooplugin.urls'),
        )
    
        @classmethod
        def get_actions(cls):
            return [...]
    
        @classmethod
        def get_blocks(cls):
            return [...]
    
        @classmethod
        def section_models(cls):
            return [...]


Available parameters reference
------------------------------

``url_prefixes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default value: ``None``

This parameter is mandatory. This is the URL prefix for all plugins urls.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        url_prefixes = (
            ('fooplugin', 'plugins.fooplugin.urls'),
            ...
        )


With this example, if plugin was activated, merengue plugin system will perform a operation like this:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
      (r'^fooplugin/', include('plugins.fooplugin.urls')),
    )

Development
===========

Writing a custom plugin
-----------------------

To write a merengue custom plugin, you need to create an Django application with several conventions:

* A defined directory layout.
* Write a configuration file.
* Extend some components.
* Extend some base models.


Plugin tree
-----------

All plugins will be placed below ``plugins`` merengue directory.

This is a conventional plugin tree:

.. code-block:: python

     /plugins/
         |-- fooplugin/
         |   |-- config.py
         |   |-- models.py
         |   |-- views.py
         |   |-- urls.py
         |   `-- templates/
         |       `-- fooplugin/
         |   `-- media/
         |       `-- fooplugin/
         |
         ...


Let's explain every part listed before:

* ``models.py`` is conventional Django app model file. See :ref:`base models <topics-models-base>` to get more info about base models you can extend of.
* ``config.py`` is the configuration file for plugin. See :ref:`plugin configuration reference <topics-plugins-configuration>`.
* ``actions.py`` is portal actions file. See :ref:`actions reference <topics-actions>`.
* ``views.py`` is conventional `Django views`_ file.
* ``urls.py`` is conventional `Django urls`_ file. You can use it for control a URL namespace (i.e. all ``/fooplugin/.*`` urls).
* ``templates/fooplugin/`` is a directory for ``fooplugin`` template namespace.
* ``media/fooplugin/`` is a directory for media resources like icons, css, etc.

Example "news" plugin
---------------------

You can see an `example plugin`_.

Required plugins in a project
-----------------------------

Sometimes your project requires that some plugins were activated by default and
user cannot deactivated them. For example project logic may rely in existence
of certains models defined in a plugin.

You can define plugins that will be installed and activated by default including
next setting in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    REQUIRED_PLUGINS = ('core', 'fooplugin', )

Default: ``('core', )`` (``core`` plugin)

.. admonition:: About ``core`` plugin

    ``core`` plugin have to be included in ``REQUIRED_PLUGINS`` to maintain all
    merengue features.

After changing ``REQUIRED_PLUGINS`` setting, you have to register plugin with this
command to get new plugins activated (and their models created if exist)::

    python manage.py migrate
