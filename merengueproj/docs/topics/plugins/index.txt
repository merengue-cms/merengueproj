.. _topics-plugins-overview:


Overview
========

Merengue *plugins* are installable components that increase the functionality
of your site. This new functionality improvement can be done in several ways:

* New content types.
* New visual blocks rendered.
* New actions for content or site.
* New permissions.
* New views (listings, content detail view, etc.).

.. admonition:: Django apps vs. Merengue plugins

    There are two main differences between Django apps and Merengue plugins:

      * Merengue plugins can be installed from admin site, without programming. Django apps usually needs (at least) change settings file, copy media, include URL namespace, etc.
      * Merengue plugins are much more tightly integrated because CMS concepts and conventions that exists in Merengue (blocks, actions, viewlets, template layout, etc.) and has no sense in a web framework.

.. _topics-plugins-installation:


Installing third party plugins
==============================

Only three steps are needed to install a new plugin:

1. Placing decompressed plugin into the ``plugins`` directory (you will find it inside your Merengue project).

2. Registering into Merengue. This can be done in two ways:

  * automatically, if you have :setting:`DETECT_BROKEN_PLUGINS` to ``True`` (by default), and you access to plugins admin view.
  * manually, if you execute ``mark_broken_plugins`` command.

3. Activate it from plugins admin view. See :ref:`plugins documentation <topics-userguide-plugins>` in user guide.

.. _topics-plugins-media-files:

Media files in plugins
----------------------

(( to be completed. Talk about media conventions taken in Merengue,
merengue.views.static.serve view and sync_plugins_media command ))

Broken plugins
--------------

Merengue detects broken plugins that are downloaded in ``plugins`` directory.
You can see it in plugins admin view:

.. image:: _images/broken_plugins.png

Merengue broken plugin detection tries to avoid break entire system when you
download a third party plugin. Broken plugin cannot be installed but if you
have a broken plugin activated, the exception will break whole system.

Plugins can be broken because one of this causes:

* **Removed from file system:** some times ago, plugin was in file system,
  and Merengue registered it, but later was deleted.

* **Models are wrong:** models does not validate.
 
* **Syntax error:** you have a syntax error in some code of the plugin. Merengue
  tried to import plugin and a ``SyntaxError`` was raised.

For detecting broken plugins you can execute ``mark_broken_plugins`` command, or
set :setting:`DETECT_BROKEN_PLUGINS` to ``True`` (by default) and access to
plugins admin view.

To debug broken plugins you have to click into the broken plugin admin edit
change form. In this view Merengue will show the error traceback:

.. image:: _images/broken_plugins_debug.png

.. _topics-plugins-customization:

Plugin customization
====================

Some plugins have some customization parameters, which appears in plugin admin view.
See :ref:`registry configuration params <topics-registry-configuration-params>`
for more details.

.. _topics-plugins-development:


Plugin development
==================

Writing a custom plugin
-----------------------

To write a merengue custom plugin, you need to create an Django application with several conventions:

* A defined directory layout.
* Write a configuration file.
* Extend some components.
* Extend some base models.


Plugin tree
-----------

All plugins will be placed below ``plugins`` merengue directory.

This is a conventional plugin tree:

.. code-block:: python

     /plugins/
         |-- fooplugin/
         |   |-- __init__.py
         |   |-- actions.py
         |   |-- blocks.py
         |   |-- config.py
         |   |-- models.py
         |   |-- views.py
         |   |-- viewlets.py
         |   |-- urls.py
         |   `-- templates/
         |       `-- fooplugin/
         |   `-- media/
         |       `-- fooplugin/
         |
         ...

.. admonition:: Note

    Only ``__init__.py`` and ``config.py`` files are mandatory.

Let's explain every part listed before:

* ``__init__.py`` is a needed file (usually empty) that makes plugin to be a python module.
* ``models.py`` is conventional Django app model file. See :ref:`base models <topics-models-base>` to get more info about base models you can extend of.
* ``config.py`` is the configuration file for plugin. See :ref:`plugin configuration reference <topics-plugins-configuration>`.
* ``blocks.py`` is blocks file, with the new visual blocks that are defined in plugin.
* ``actions.py`` is actions file.
* ``views.py`` is conventional `Django views`_ file.
* ``urls.py`` is conventional `Django urls`_ file. You can use it for controlling a URL namespace (i.e. all ``/fooplugin/.*`` urls).
* ``templates/fooplugin/`` is a directory for ``fooplugin`` template namespace.
* ``media/fooplugin/`` is a directory for media resources like icons, css, etc.

.. _topics-plugins-configuration:

Plugin configuration
--------------------

Plugin configuration is defined in a ``PluginConfig`` class in a ``config.py`` module inside your plugin directory. This class is readed when plugin is loaded in merengue.

This is a ``config.py`` file code fragment example:

.. code-block:: python

    from merengue.pluggable import Plugin

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):

        name = "Foo plugin"

        url_prefixes = (
            ('fooplugin', 'plugins.fooplugin.urls'),
        )

        def get_actions(self):
            return [...]

        def get_blocks(self):
            return [...]

        def section_models(self):
            return [...]

        # ... etcetera

Parameters reference
--------------------

Plugin metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``name`` parameter is used to give this plugin a name that will be
visible in the Merengue plugin control center. It is a required parameter
and usually it is just a single word or two.

The ``descrpition`` parameter add some more information for this plugin.
It can be a full sentence that will help the Merengue administrator to
decide if it is worthy to install this plugin.

Finally the ``version`` parameter is a string with the version information
of the plugin. It is not required but highly recommended.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):

        name = "Foo"
        description = "Demo plugin to explain how to create Merengue plugins"
        version = "1.0.0"

Plugin URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``url_prefixes`` parameter is the URL prefix for all your plugin urls.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        url_prefixes = (
            ('fooplugin', 'plugins.fooplugin.urls'),
            ...
        )


With this example, if plugin was activated, all urls below ``fooplugin`` will
be handled by ``plugins.fooplugin.urls`` module. Internally, merengue plugin
system will perform a operation like this:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
      (r'^fooplugin/', include('plugins.fooplugin.urls')),
    )

You can also internazionalize your plugins URLs. See this example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # ... stuff
        url_prefixes = (
            ({'en': 'event', 'es': 'eventos'},
             'plugins.event.urls'),
        )

The final URL prefix used will depend of the ``URL_DEFAULT_LANG`` setting (by
default will be same as ``LANGUAGE_CODE``).

.. note::
    Your site will have only **one** prefix for every url prefixes you have
    internazionalized. So, if your ``URL_DEFAULT_LANG`` is ``"es"``, only
    ``/eventos`` will be handled for the plugin and ``/event`` will raise a 404
    error.

Plugin possibilities
--------------------

A developer can do a lot of things when developing a new Plugin:


* **Defining new blocks**, implementing the ``get_blocks(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. See :ref:`blocks reference <topics-blocks>`. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from plugins.fooplugin.blocks import FooBlock

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_blocks(self):
            return [FooBlock, ]

* **Defining new actions**, implementing the ``get_actions(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. See :ref:`actions reference <topics-actions>`. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from plugins.fooplugin.actions import FooAction

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_actions(self):
            return [FooAction, ]

* **Creates new models**, implementing those models in the plugin ``models.py`` file. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from merengue.base.models import BaseContent

    class FooContent(BaseContent):
        new_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        # stuff ...

* **Defining a plugin custom admin site**, implementing the ``get_model_admins(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from plugins.fooplugin.admin import FooContentAdmin, FooCategoryAdmin
    from plugins.fooplugin.models import FooContent, FooCategory

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_model_admins(self):
            return [(FooContent, FooContentAdmin),
                    (FooCategory, FooCategoryAdmin)]

* **Defining new permissions**, implementing the ``get_perms(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. See :ref:`permissions reference <topics-permissions>`. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from plugins.forum.models import FooContent

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_perms(self):
            return [('Vote foo', 'vote_foo', [FooContent]), ), ]

* **Defining new viewlets**, implementing the ``get_viewlets(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. See :ref:`viewlets reference <topics-viewlets>`. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from plugins.fooplugin.viewlets import FooViewlet1, FooViewlet2

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_viewlets(self):
            return [FooViewlet1, FooViewlet2]

* **Defining new middlewares**, implementing the ``get_middlewares(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. See `Django middleware reference`_. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def get_middlewares(self):
            return ['plugins.fooplugin.middleware.FooMiddleware', ]

.. _`Django middleware reference`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/http/middleware/

* **Anything you want after plugin activation**, implementing the ``hook_post_register(self)`` method in the ``PluginConfig`` class. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.core.mail import send_mail

    class PluginConfig(Plugin):
        # stuff ...

        def hook_post_register(self):
            send_mail('Foo plugin enabled', 'The foo plugin has been enabled.', 'from@example.com',
                      'admin@example.com', fail_silently=True)

Example plugins
---------------

In the Merengue `plugins directory`_ you can browse several plugins implemented, like the `news plugin`_.

.. _`plugins directory`: http://tracpub.yaco.es/merengue/browser/trunk/merengueproj/plugins/
.. _`news plugin`: http://tracpub.yaco.es/merengue/browser/trunk/merengueproj/plugins/news/

Required plugins in a project
-----------------------------

Sometimes your project requires that some plugins were activated by default and
user cannot deactivated them. For example project logic may rely in existence
of certains models defined in a plugin.

You can define plugins that will be installed and activated by default including
next setting in your project settings:

.. code-block:: python

    REQUIRED_PLUGINS = ('core', 'fooplugin', )

Default: ``('core', )`` (``core`` plugin)

.. admonition:: About ``core`` plugin

    ``core`` plugin have to be included in ``REQUIRED_PLUGINS`` to maintain all
    merengue features.

After changing ``REQUIRED_PLUGINS`` setting, you have to register plugin with this
command to get new plugins activated (and also get their models created if exist)::

    python manage.py migrate

South migrations in plugins
---------------------------

If your plugin change its models and you want a clean migration in websites
with your plugin installed, you may need to implement `South`_ migrations on it.

For creating south migrations, you have to use the ``schemamigration`` and
``datamigration`` commands (see `South docs`_ for more information). You only
have to remember to add temporary the plugin name to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
before executing those commands, because south does not find enabled plugins by
itself.

When a plugin with south migrations is installed, Merengue automatically will
execute its South migrations. To execute plugins migrations in already
installed plugins you have to uninstall and install the plugin in Merengue admin.

Also, there is a useful ``migrate_plugins`` command which migrates all enabled
plugins in your website. There are some example of use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py migrate_plugins  # migrate all enabled plugins
    $ python manage.py migrate_plugins --list  # show migration list of enabled plugins
    $ python manage.py migrate_plugins forum  # migrate only forum plugin, if enabled
    $ python manage.py migrate_plugins forum 0002  # migrate only 0002* step for forum plugin
    $ python manage.py migrate_plugins forum 0001_initial  # fakes 0001_initial step for forum plugin
