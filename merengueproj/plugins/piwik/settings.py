# default date range and metric to get piwik stats
PERIOD = 'year'
DATE = 'today'
METRIC = 'nb_visits'

# You can trace stats by custom variables instead page titles.
#IMPORTANT: if you change it to True,you must change
# the visit_standard_length to 0 in /var/www/piwik/config/global.ini.php so piwik
# traces fine. This change means losing some statistics like avg_time_on_page
